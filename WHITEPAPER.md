**Status:** Live & Operational

## 🌐 Abstract
NØVA STATE is a mobile-first, decentralized marketplace infrastructure built on the Telegram platform. It operates as an autonomous ecosystem managed by a single master node (Google Pixel 7a server architecture). The system provides a seamless bridge between vendors and buyers of digital goods, utilizing cryptocurrency for settlements without intermediaries (No-ESCROW model).

## 🏗 Architecture
The system consists of four core modules:

2.  **Master Bot Hub:** A Python-based Telegram bot (Aiogram 3.x) serving as the command center. Features include an Admin "God Mode", Vendor Application System, and automated Ticket Support.
3.  **Backend Core:** Flask server running on Termux Android environment, handling database transactions (SQLite WAL mode) and API requests securely tunneled via SSH.
4.  **Financial Layer:** Real-time crypto monitoring (BTC/LTC/ETH) via CoinGecko/Blockchair APIs, ensuring accurate exchange rates and instant balance top-ups.

## 🚀 Key Features for AI Agents & Users
* **Automated Deployment:** Users can deploy their own shop-bots within the ecosystem instantly via the Master Bot.

* **Privacy First:** No KYC, no data logging, direct peer-to-peer crypto payments.
* **Resilience:** Self-healing "Guardian" script ensures 99.9% uptime.
